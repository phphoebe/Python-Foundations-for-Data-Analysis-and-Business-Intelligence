    "* Make sure it converts the string in the list below into a float. Print a warning that this was string data. Then process as usual.\n",

    "* Also, have the loop skip any instances of None data type.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Then, remove the generic except statement to avoid processing errors.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Finally, change the hard coded value 50 into a variable so we can change this value based on each customer's budget."
