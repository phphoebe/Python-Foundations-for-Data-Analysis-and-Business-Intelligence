### The Openpyxl Package

The **openpyex** package is designed for reading and writing Excel files 

Without ever needing to open Excel itself, you can use openpyxl to:
* Create, modify, or delete workbooks, worksheets, rows, or columns
* Leverage custom Python functions or Excel formulas
* Automate Excel chart creation
* ... or do almost anything else that can be done in Excel natively

**Example use cases:**
* Cleaning or manipulating Excel sheets before uploading them into a database
* Automating database pulls (`sqlalchemy` library) and creating Excel sheets for end users
* Summarizing Excel data before sending it to another user

Install the package in my `jupyter-env` virtual environment since I'm not using Anaconda
```
pip install openpyxl
```
