## Python Foundations for Data Analysis & Business Intelligence

This repository consists of some of the assignments and hands-on practices that I have done by taking the [Python Foundations for Data Analysis & Business Intelligence](https://www.udemy.com/course/python-foundations-for-data-analysis/) course on Udemy. The course covers the building blocks of base Python for Data Analysis & BI: 

* Master the building blocks of base Python, including data types, variables, loops, functions and more
* Learn how to use Jupyter Notebooks to write, manage, and comment your Python code
* Analyze and manipulate numeric data, text strings, lists, tuples, dictionaries and sets
* Explore raw data using conditional logic, nested loops, custom functions, and comprehensions
* Use Python's Openpyxl package to read & write data to Excel worksheets
* Build solid, foundational Python skills for data analysis & business intelligence
